# Ralph Loop — Eigenpal DOCX Editor (Optimized)

## Your job

You are running inside a Ralph autonomous loop. Each iteration you must:

1. Read the current plan file in `.ralph/` (highest numbered `##_*.md` file).
2. Find the **first** unchecked task (`- [ ]`).
3. If all tasks are checked, output the exit signal and stop.
4. **🔍 MANDATORY: Research WYSIWYG Editor FIRST** — Before writing ANY code, search `reference/wysiwyg-editor` for how they solved this exact problem. Log what you found in progress.txt.
5. Implement ONLY that one task (using insights from step 4).
6. Run the **fast verify**: `bun run typecheck` (catches most errors in <5s)
7. Run **targeted tests only** - see "Test Strategy" below
8. If tests pass, mark task done, commit, update `.ralph/progress.txt`
9. Output RALPH_STATUS block.

```
RALPH_STATUS: {
  "status": "in_progress" | "complete",
  "current_task": "<task title>" | "none",
  "exit_signal": false | true
}
```

## Progress Tracking — So User Knows What's Happening

**UPDATE `.ralph/progress.txt` FREQUENTLY** — every 2-3 minutes minimum, or after each significant action. The user is watching this file to know what you're doing.

**Update after EACH of these actions:**

- Starting a new task
- Reading a key file (note which file and what you learned)
- Making an edit (note which file and what changed)
- Running a command (note result)
- Encountering an issue or insight
- Completing a task

Format (append to file):

```
[TIMESTAMP] TASK: <task title>
[TIMESTAMP] STATUS: starting | researching-wysiwyg-editor | reading | editing | running | testing | done | failed
[TIMESTAMP] NOTES: <brief description - include file names and specifics>
```

**REQUIRED STATUS SEQUENCE:** Every task MUST include `researching-wysiwyg-editor` status BEFORE `editing`.

Example (notice WYSIWYG Editor research is MANDATORY before editing):

```
[2024-02-02 10:15] TASK: Fix getSelectionRange for cursor-only
[2024-02-02 10:15] STATUS: starting
[2024-02-02 10:16] STATUS: researching-wysiwyg-editor
[2024-02-02 10:16] NOTES: Searching WYSIWYG Editor for "selection" and "collapsed"
[2024-02-02 10:17] NOTES: Found selection handling in reference/wysiwyg-editor/packages/editor/src/selection-manager.ts
[2024-02-02 10:18] NOTES: WYSIWYG Editor approach: They expand collapsed selection to paragraph boundaries
[2024-02-02 10:19] NOTES: Key insight: isCollapsed check should NOT return null, should find containing paragraph
[2024-02-02 10:20] STATUS: reading
[2024-02-02 10:20] NOTES: Reading our AIEditor.tsx:105 - comparing to WYSIWYG Editor approach
[2024-02-02 10:21] STATUS: editing
[2024-02-02 10:21] NOTES: Edited AIEditor.tsx - implemented paragraph expansion (based on WYSIWYG Editor concept)
[2024-02-02 10:22] STATUS: running
[2024-02-02 10:22] NOTES: Running typecheck - passed
[2024-02-02 10:23] STATUS: testing
[2024-02-02 10:23] NOTES: Tests pass - 11/11 cursor-only tests green
[2024-02-02 10:23] STATUS: done
```

**User can monitor progress with:**

```bash
tail -f .ralph/progress.txt
```

## Subagents — Use For Complex Tasks

You can spin up **subagents** for parallel work. Use the Task tool with appropriate agent types:

- **Explore agent** - For codebase exploration, finding files, understanding architecture
- **Plan agent** - For designing implementation approaches
- **Bash agent** - For running commands, git operations

**When to use subagents:**

- Searching across multiple files for a pattern
- Investigating how a feature works across the codebase
- Running parallel test suites
- Complex research tasks

**Example:**

```
Use Task tool with subagent_type="Explore" to find all files that handle selection
```

## SPEED OPTIMIZATIONS — Read This First

### Fast Verification Cycle

**DO NOT run the full test suite.** Run targeted tests only:

```bash
# Step 1: Type check (fast, catches 90% of issues)
bun run typecheck

# Step 2: Run ONLY the relevant test file(s)
npx playwright test tests/<relevant>.spec.ts --timeout=30000 --workers=4

# Step 3: If fixing a specific test, use --grep
npx playwright test --grep "test name pattern" --timeout=30000
```

### Test File Mapping

| Feature Area          | Test File                      | Quick Verify Pattern    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Bold/Italic/Underline | `formatting.spec.ts`           | `--grep "apply bold"`   |
| Alignment             | `alignment.spec.ts`            | `--grep "align text"`   |
| Lists                 | `lists.spec.ts`                | `--grep "bullet list"`  |
| Colors                | `colors.spec.ts`               | `--grep "text color"`   |
| Fonts                 | `fonts.spec.ts`                | `--grep "font family"`  |
| Enter/Paragraphs      | `text-editing.spec.ts`         | `--grep "Enter"`        |
| Undo/Redo             | `scenario-driven.spec.ts`      | `--grep "undo"`         |
| Line spacing          | `line-spacing.spec.ts`         | `--grep "line spacing"` |
| Paragraph styles      | `paragraph-styles.spec.ts`     | `--grep "Heading"`      |
| Toolbar state         | `toolbar-state.spec.ts`        | `--grep "toolbar"`      |
| **Cursor-only ops**   | `cursor-paragraph-ops.spec.ts` | `--grep "cursor only"`  |

### Avoid Hanging

- **Never run all 500+ tests at once** unless explicitly validating final results
- Use `--timeout=30000` (30s max per test)
- Use `--workers=4` for parallel execution
- If a command takes >60s, Ctrl+C and retry with narrower scope
- Avoid `git log` with large outputs; use `--oneline -10`

## 🔍 MANDATORY: Research WYSIWYG Editor Before EVERY Task

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.** Before writing a single line of code for any task, you MUST:

### Step 1: Search WYSIWYG Editor for the relevant feature

```bash
# Search for keywords related to your task
grep -r "<keyword>" reference/wysiwyg-editor/packages --include="*.ts" -l

# Examples:
grep -r "alignment" reference/wysiwyg-editor/packages --include="*.ts" -l
grep -r "bullet" reference/wysiwyg-editor/packages --include="*.ts" -l
grep -r "selection" reference/wysiwyg-editor/packages --include="*.ts" -l
grep -r "format" reference/wysiwyg-editor/packages --include="*.ts" -l
```

### Step 2: Read the relevant WYSIWYG Editor files

```bash
# Read the files you found (first 300 lines usually enough)
cat reference/wysiwyg-editor/packages/editor/src/<file>.ts | head -300
```

### Step 3: Log what you learned in progress.txt

```
[TIMESTAMP] STATUS: researching-wysiwyg-editor
[TIMESTAMP] NOTES: Searched for "alignment" - found in toolbar.ts, paragraph-operations.ts
[TIMESTAMP] NOTES: WYSIWYG Editor approach: They use getParagraphAtCursor() to find current paragraph
[TIMESTAMP] NOTES: Key insight: They handle collapsed selection by expanding to full paragraph
```

### Step 4: CLOSE the WYSIWYG Editor file, then write your own implementation

**YOU MUST LOG THE REFERENCE RESEARCH.** If progress.txt doesn't show WYSIWYG Editor research before implementation, you skipped this step.

## WYSIWYG Editor Reference — ⚠️ LEGAL: CLEAN ROOM ONLY ⚠️

### Live Demo — Check Expected Behavior First!

**Before implementing, check how it SHOULD work:**

🌐 **https://www.wysiwyg-editor.dev/** — Live working DOCX editor

Use this to:

- See expected UX behavior (click button → what happens?)
- Verify cursor-only operations work (click in paragraph, click alignment)
- Check how lists, indentation, formatting should behave
- Compare your implementation against working reference

### Local Reference: WYSIWYG Editor (`reference/wysiwyg-editor`)

When stuck on implementation, **check WYSIWYG Editor source** — it's a working OOXML editor:

```bash
# Understand repo structure
ls reference/wysiwyg-editor/packages/editor/src/

# Read specific files for concepts
cat reference/wysiwyg-editor/packages/editor/src/[relevant-file].ts | head -200

# Search for how something is handled
grep -r "selectionChanged" reference/wysiwyg-editor/packages --include="*.ts" -l
```

**Use WYSIWYG Editor to understand:**

- How OOXML concepts are implemented in practice
- Edge cases that specs don't make clear
- DOM APIs and event sequences used
- Architecture patterns for editor components
- **How selection works with cursor-only (no text selected)**

### ⚠️ CRITICAL LEGAL RULES — AGPL-3.0 COPYLEFT ⚠️

WYSIWYG Editor is licensed under **AGPL-3.0**, a strong copyleft license. If you copy ANY code:

- The ENTIRE EigenPal project becomes AGPL-3.0
- You MUST open-source all code
- This is INCOMPATIBLE with commercial use for banks

**CLEAN ROOM IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED:**

1. ❌ **NEVER copy-paste code** — not even a single function
2. ❌ **NEVER copy variable names, function signatures, or class structures**
3. ❌ **NEVER copy comments or documentation text**
4. ✅ **DO read to understand the CONCEPT**
5. ✅ **DO close the file before writing**
6. ✅ **DO write your own implementation from scratch**

**The process:**

```
1. CHECK wysiwyg-editor.dev to see expected behavior
2. READ WYSIWYG Editor source to understand the concept
3. CLOSE the file
4. WRITE your own implementation from memory/understanding
```

**✅ GOOD — Clean room approach:**

```
I checked wysiwyg-editor.dev - clicking Center button with cursor (no selection)
centers the current paragraph. I read WYSIWYG Editor source and understand that
selection handling needs to work even when selection.isCollapsed is true.

My implementation (written fresh):
function getSelectionRange(...) {
  // My own logic based on understanding...
}
```

**❌ BAD — Copyright infringement:**

```typescript
// Based on reference/wysiwyg-editor/packages/editor/src/selection.ts
function calculateOffset(node, offset) {
  // Any code that resembles WYSIWYG Editor
}
```

---

## ECMA-376 Official Spec — Secondary Reference

The DOCX format is standardized as ECMA-376 / ISO-29500. Local reference docs:

```bash
# Quick reference
reference/quick-ref/wordprocessingml.md   # Paragraphs, runs, formatting
reference/quick-ref/themes-colors.md      # Theme colors, fonts, tints

# XML Schemas
reference/ecma-376/part1/schemas/wml.xsd      # WordprocessingML
reference/ecma-376/part1/schemas/dml-main.xsd # DrawingML (themes, colors)

# Full spec PDFs (5000+ pages)
reference/ecma-376/part1/*.pdf
```

**Online resources:**

- ECMA-376: https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-376/
- Microsoft Open Specs: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_standards/ms-oe376/

**When in doubt about legal safety:** The ECMA-376 spec is always safe to reference directly.

## WYSIWYG Fidelity — Hard Rule

This is a WYSIWYG editor. Output must look identical to Microsoft Word.

**Must preserve:**

- **Fonts:** Custom/embedded fonts render correctly
- **Theme colors:** Theme slots (`dk1`, `lt1`, `accent1`) resolve to correct colors
- **Styles:** styles.xml definitions apply (headings, body, character styles)
- **Character formatting:** Bold, italic, font size/family/color, highlight, underline, strikethrough
- **Tables:** Borders, cell shading, merged cells
- **Headers/footers:** Render on each page
- **Section layout:** Margins, page size, orientation

---

## Known Critical Bugs

### 1. Cursor-Only Paragraph Operations (ROOT CAUSE)

**Problem:** In Word/Google Docs, paragraph operations (lists, alignment, indent) work when cursor is in a paragraph WITHOUT selecting text. Our editor requires text selection.

**Root cause:** `getSelectionRange()` in `AIEditor.tsx:105` returns `null` when `selection.isCollapsed` is true:

```tsx
if (!selection || selection.isCollapsed) return null; // ← THE BUG
```

**To verify expected behavior:** Go to https://www.wysiwyg-editor.dev/, click in a paragraph, click Center button — it should center without selection.

### 2. Multi-Paragraph Formatting

Only first paragraph gets formatted when multiple are selected. Need to loop from `start.paragraphIndex` to `end.paragraphIndex`.

### 3. Multi-Selection Across Formatting

When selecting text spanning multiple runs with different formatting (bold → normal → italic), selection breaks.

## Verify Commands

**Fast cycle (use this 95% of the time):**

```bash
bun run typecheck && npx playwright test --grep "<pattern>" --timeout=30000 --workers=4
```

**Single test file:**

```bash
bun run typecheck && npx playwright test tests/formatting.spec.ts --timeout=30000
```

**Cursor-only operations (new critical tests):**

```bash
npx playwright test tests/cursor-paragraph-ops.spec.ts --timeout=30000 --workers=4
```

**Full suite (only for final validation):**

```bash
bun run typecheck && npx playwright test --timeout=60000 --workers=4
```

---

## Rules

- **Screenshots:** Save to `screenshots/` folder
- Work on exactly ONE task per iteration
- Do NOT modify other tasks in the plan
- Do NOT delete files from previous tasks unless required
- Client-side only. No backend.
- No collaboration, comments, tracked changes, or PDF export
- **🔍 MANDATORY: Search `reference/wysiwyg-editor` for how they solved the problem BEFORE writing any code**
- **Log WYSIWYG Editor research in progress.txt with `STATUS: researching-wysiwyg-editor`**
- **Check wysiwyg-editor.dev for expected behavior before implementing**

---

## Project Context

Minimal Bun + React (TSX) app for EigenPal:

1. **Display DOCX** — render with full WYSIWYG fidelity per ECMA-376 spec
2. **Insert docxtemplater variables** — `{{variable}}` mappings with live preview

Target users: Non-technical clients at European banks/insurance companies.

## When Stuck

1. **Did you check WYSIWYG Editor?** — If not, go back and search `reference/wysiwyg-editor` FIRST. This should have been done before you started coding.
2. **Check expected behavior** — Visit https://www.wysiwyg-editor.dev/ to see how it should work
3. **Type error?** Read the actual types, don't guess
4. **Test failing?** Run with `--debug` and check console output
5. **Selection bug?** Add `console.log` in `getSelectionRange()` to trace
6. **Still stuck after WYSIWYG Editor?** Search for more keywords: `grep -r "<another-keyword>" reference/wysiwyg-editor/packages --include="*.ts" -l`
7. **OOXML spec question?** Check `reference/quick-ref/` or ECMA-376 schemas
8. **Timeout?** Kill command, narrow test scope, retry
9. **Complex task?** Spin up a subagent with Task tool
